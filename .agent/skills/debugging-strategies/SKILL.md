# Debugging Strategies

Transform debugging from frustrating guesswork into systematic problem-solving with proven strategies, powerful tools, and methodical approaches.

## Use this skill when

- Tracking down elusive bugs
- Investigating performance issues
- Debugging production incidents
- Analyzing crash dumps or stack traces
- Debugging distributed systems

## Do not use this skill when

- There is no reproducible issue or observable symptom
- The task is purely feature development
- You cannot access logs, traces, or runtime signals

## Instructions

- Reproduce the issue and capture logs, traces, and environment details.
- Form hypotheses and design controlled experiments.
- Narrow scope with binary search and targeted instrumentation.
- Document findings and verify the fix.
- If detailed playbooks are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed debugging patterns and checklists.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
