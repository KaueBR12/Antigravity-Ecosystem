# Check if conductor directory exists
ls -la conductor/

# Find all track directories
ls -la conductor/tracks/

# Check for required files
ls conductor/index.md conductor/product.md conductor/tech-stack.md conductor/workflow.md conductor/tracks.md
```

## Use this skill when

- Working on check if conductor directory exists tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for check if conductor directory exists

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to check if conductor directory exists
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Pattern Matching

**Status markers in tracks.md:**

```
- [ ] Track Name  # Not started
- [~] Track Name  # In progress
- [x] Track Name  # Complete
```

**Task markers in plan.md:**

```
- [ ] Task description  # Pending
- [~] Task description  # In progress
- [x] Task description  # Complete
```

**Track ID pattern:**

```
<type>_<name>_<YYYYMMDD>
Example: feature_user_auth_20250115
```

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
