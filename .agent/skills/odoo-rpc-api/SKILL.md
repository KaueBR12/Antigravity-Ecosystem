# Odoo RPC API

## Overview

Odoo exposes a powerful external API via JSON-RPC and XML-RPC, allowing any external application to read, create, update, and delete records. This skill guides you through authenticating, calling models, and building robust integrations.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Connecting an external app (e.g., Django, Node.js, a mobile app) to Odoo.
- Running automated scripts to import/export data from Odoo.
- Building a middleware layer between Odoo and a third-party platform.
- Debugging API authentication or permission errors.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-rpc-api` and describe the integration you need.
2. **Generate**: Get copy-paste ready RPC call code in Python, JavaScript, or curl.
3. **Debug**: Paste an error and get a diagnosis with a corrected call.

## Examples

### Example 1: Authenticate and Read Records (Python)

```python
import xmlrpc.client

url = 'https://myodoo.example.com'
db = 'my_database'
username = 'admin'
password = 'my_api_key'  # Use API keys, not passwords, in production

# Step 1: Authenticate
common = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/2/common')
uid = common.authenticate(db, username, password, {})
print(f"Authenticated as UID: {uid}")

# Step 2: Call models
models = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(f'{url}/xmlrpc/2/object')

# Search confirmed sale orders
orders = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,
    'sale.order', 'search_read',
    [[['state', '=', 'sale']]],
    {'fields': ['name', 'partner_id', 'amount_total'], 'limit': 10}
)
for order in orders:
    print(order)
```

### Example 2: Create a Record (Python)

```python
new_partner_id = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,
    'res.partner', 'create',
    [{'name': 'Acme Corp', 'email': 'info@acme.com', 'is_company': True}]
)
print(f"Created partner ID: {new_partner_id}")
```

### Example 3: JSON-RPC via curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://myodoo.example.com/web/dataset/call_kw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "call",
    "id": 1,
    "params": {
      "model": "res.partner",
      "method": "search_read",
      "args": [[["is_company", "=", true]]],
      "kwargs": {"fields": ["name", "email"], "limit": 5}
    }
  }'
# Note: "id" is required by the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec to correlate responses.
# Odoo 16+ also supports the /web/dataset/call_kw endpoint but
# prefer /web/dataset/call_kw for model method calls.
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Use **API Keys** (Settings → Technical → API Keys) instead of passwords — available from Odoo 14+.
- ✅ **Do:** Use `search_read` instead of `search` + `read` to reduce network round trips.
- ✅ **Do:** Always handle connection errors and implement retry logic with exponential backoff in production.
- ✅ **Do:** Store credentials in environment variables or a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, `.env` file).
- ❌ **Don't:** Hardcode passwords or API keys directly in scripts — rotate them and use env vars.
- ❌ **Don't:** Call the API in a tight loop without batching — bulk operations reduce server load significantly.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use the master admin password for API integrations — create a dedicated integration user with minimum required permissions.

## Limitations

- Does not cover **OAuth2 or session-cookie-based authentication** — the examples use API key (token) auth only.
- **Rate limiting** is not built into the Odoo XMLRPC layer; you must implement throttling client-side.
- The XML-RPC endpoint (`/xmlrpc/2/`) does not support file uploads — use the REST-based `ir.attachment` model via JSON-RPC for binary data.
- Odoo.sh (SaaS) may block some API calls depending on plan; verify your subscription supports external API access.
