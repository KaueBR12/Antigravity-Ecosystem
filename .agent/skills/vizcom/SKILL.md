# Vizcom Skill

[Vizcom](https://vizcom.com/) is an AI-driven platform designed to accelerate the ideation and rendering process, turning rough inputs into breathtaking visualizations.

## Context

Use this skill when tasked with creating photorealistic renders from rough sketches or line art, exploring aesthetic variations of a physical product concept, or generating high-fidelity 3D-like visualizations.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when:

- Designing physical products (furniture, electronics, transportation, consumer goods).
- A user provides a sketch or a description of a product and needs a professional, awe-inspiring render.
- Generating "mood" or "concept" imagery for hardware or tangible UI projects.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Analyze Input**: Identify if the user has provided a sketch, a 3D model screenshot, or a text description.
2. **Define Style**: Choose a specific **Render Style** (e.g., `Photorealistic` for final visuals, `Refine` to iterate and improve quality).
3. **Draft Premium Prompt**: Formulate precise prompts. Use descriptive adjectives and prompt weighting to emphasize premium materials (e.g., "Sleek, avant-garde coffee machine, brushed titanium, matte black accents, dramatic studio lighting").
4. **Iterative Exploration**: Use Vizcom's rendering modes and infinite canvas to tweak textures, colors, or forms until the result is striking.
5. **Finalize**: Present the high-fidelity render.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning designs. DO NOT build in common or generic styles. Avoid safe, boring product shapes.
- **Material Precision**: Always specify rich textures (e.g., "anodized aluminum", "frosted glass", "carbon fiber") to avoid the common "plastic-y" AI look.
- **Lighting is Key**: Always include lighting directions in the prompt (e.g., "cinematic lighting", "high contrast shadows") to elevate the visual impact.
