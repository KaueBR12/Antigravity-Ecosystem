# Claude Code Guide

## Purpose

To provide a comprehensive reference for configuring and using Claude Code (the agentic coding tool) to its full potential. This skill synthesizes best practices, configuration templates, and advanced usage patterns.

## Configuration (`CLAUDE.md`)

When starting a new project, create a `CLAUDE.md` file in the root directory to guide the agent.

### Template (General)

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Commands

- Run app: `npm run dev`
- Test: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Functional components with Hooks for React.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Early returns for error handling.

## Workflow

- Read `README.md` first to understand project context.
- Before editing, read the file content.
- After editing, run tests to verify.
```

## Advanced Features

### Thinking Keywords

Use these keywords in your prompts to trigger deeper reasoning from the agent:

- "Think step-by-step"
- "Analyze the root cause"
- "Plan before executing"
- "Verify your assumptions"

### Debugging

If the agent is stuck or behaving unexpectedly:

1. **Clear Context**: Start a new session or ask the agent to "forget previous instructions" if confused.
2. **Explicit Instructions**: Be extremely specific about paths, filenames, and desired outcomes.
3. **Logs**: Ask the agent to "check the logs" or "run the command with verbose output".

## Best Practices

1. **Small Contexts**: Don't dump the entire codebase into the context. Use `grep` or `find` to locate relevant files first.
2. **Iterative Development**: Ask for small changes, verify, then proceed.
3. **Feedback Loop**: If the agent makes a mistake, correct it immediately and ask it to "add a lesson" to its memory (if supported) or `CLAUDE.md`.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
