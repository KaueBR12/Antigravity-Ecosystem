# Algolia Search Integration

## Patterns

### React InstantSearch with Hooks

Modern React InstantSearch setup using hooks for type-ahead search.

Uses react-instantsearch-hooks-web package with algoliasearch client.
Widgets are components that can be customized with classnames.

Key hooks:
- useSearchBox: Search input handling
- useHits: Access search results
- useRefinementList: Facet filtering
- usePagination: Result pagination
- useInstantSearch: Full state access

### Next.js Server-Side Rendering

SSR integration for Next.js with react-instantsearch-nextjs package.

Use <InstantSearchNext> instead of <InstantSearch> for SSR.
Supports both Pages Router and App Router (experimental).

Key considerations:
- Set dynamic = 'force-dynamic' for fresh results
- Handle URL synchronization with routing prop
- Use getServerState for initial state

### Data Synchronization and Indexing

Indexing strategies for keeping Algolia in sync with your data.

Three main approaches:
1. Full Reindexing - Replace entire index (expensive)
2. Full Record Updates - Replace individual records
3. Partial Updates - Update specific attributes only

Best practices:
- Batch records (ideal: 10MB, 1K-10K records per batch)
- Use incremental updates when possible
- partialUpdateObjects for attribute-only changes
- Avoid deleteBy (computationally expensive)

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
