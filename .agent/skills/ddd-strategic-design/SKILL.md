# DDD Strategic Design

## Use this skill when

- Defining core, supporting, and generic subdomains.
- Splitting a monolith or service landscape by domain boundaries.
- Aligning teams and ownership with bounded contexts.
- Building a shared ubiquitous language with domain experts.

## Do not use this skill when

- The domain model is stable and already well bounded.
- You need tactical code patterns only.
- The task is purely infrastructure or UI oriented.

## Instructions

1. Extract domain capabilities and classify subdomains.
2. Define bounded contexts around consistency and ownership.
3. Establish a ubiquitous language glossary and anti-terms.
4. Capture context boundaries in ADRs before implementation.

If detailed templates are needed, open `references/strategic-design-template.md`.

## Required artifacts

- Subdomain classification table
- Bounded context catalog
- Glossary with canonical terms
- Boundary decisions with rationale

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## Examples

```text
Use @ddd-strategic-design to map our commerce domain into bounded contexts,
classify subdomains, and propose team ownership.
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not produce executable code.
- It cannot infer business truth without stakeholder input.
- It should be followed by tactical design before implementation.
