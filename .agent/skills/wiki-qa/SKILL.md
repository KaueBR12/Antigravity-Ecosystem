# Wiki Q&A

Answer repository questions grounded entirely in source code evidence.

## When to Activate

- User asks a question about the codebase
- User wants to understand a specific file, function, or component
- User asks "how does X work" or "where is Y defined"

## Procedure

1. Detect the language of the question; respond in the same language
2. Search the codebase for relevant files
3. Read those files to gather evidence
4. Synthesize an answer with inline citations

## Response Format

- Use `##` headings, code blocks with language tags, tables, bullet lists
- Cite sources inline: `(src/path/file.ts:42)`
- Include a "Key Files" table mapping files to their roles
- If information is insufficient, say so and suggest files to examine

## Rules

- ONLY use information from actual source files
- NEVER invent, guess, or use external knowledge
- Think step by step before answering

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
