# Progressive Estimation

Estimate AI-assisted and hybrid human+agent development work using research-backed formulas with PERT statistics, confidence bands, and calibration feedback loops.

## Overview

Progressive Estimation adapts to your team's working mode — human-only, hybrid, or agent-first — applying the right velocity model and multipliers for each. It produces statistical estimates rather than gut feelings.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Estimating development tasks where AI agents handle part of the work
- Sprint planning with hybrid human+agent teams
- Batch sizing a backlog (handles 5 or 500 issues)
- Staffing and capacity planning with agent multipliers
- Release date forecasting with confidence intervals

## How It Works

1. **Mode Detection** — Determines if the team works human-only, hybrid, or agent-first
2. **Task Classification** — Categorizes by size (XS–XL), complexity, and risk
3. **Formula Application** — Applies research-backed multipliers grounded in empirical studies
4. **PERT Calculation** — Produces expected values using three-point estimation
5. **Confidence Bands** — Generates P50, P75, P90 intervals
6. **Output Formatting** — Formats for Linear, JIRA, ClickUp, GitHub Issues, Monday, or GitLab
7. **Calibration** — Feeds back actuals to improve future estimates

## Examples

**Single task:**
> "Estimate building a REST API with authentication using Claude Code"

**Batch mode:**
> "Estimate these 12 JIRA tickets for our next sprint"

**With context:**
> "We have 3 developers using AI agents for ~60% of implementation. Estimate this feature."

## Best Practices

- Start with a single task to calibrate before moving to batch mode
- Feed back actual completion times to improve the calibration system
- Use "instant mode" for quick T-shirt sizing without full PERT analysis
- Be explicit about team composition and agent usage percentage

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Overconfident estimates
  **Solution:** Use P75 or P90 for commitments, not P50

- **Problem:** Missing context
  **Solution:** The skill asks clarifying questions — provide team size and agent usage

- **Problem:** Stale calibration
  **Solution:** Re-calibrate when team composition or tooling changes significantly
