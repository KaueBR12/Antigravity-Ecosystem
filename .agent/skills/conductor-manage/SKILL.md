# Track Manager

Manage the complete track lifecycle including archiving, restoring, deleting, renaming, and cleaning up orphaned artifacts.

## Use this skill when

- Archiving, restoring, renaming, or deleting Conductor tracks
- Listing track status or cleaning orphaned artifacts
- Managing the track lifecycle across active, completed, and archived states

## Do not use this skill when

- Conductor is not initialized in the repository
- You lack permission to modify track metadata or files
- The task is unrelated to Conductor track management

## Instructions

- Verify `conductor/` structure and required files before proceeding.
- Determine the operation mode from arguments or interactive prompts.
- Confirm destructive actions (delete/cleanup) before applying.
- Update `tracks.md` and metadata consistently.
- If detailed steps are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Backup track data before delete operations.
- Avoid removing archived tracks without explicit approval.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed modes, prompts, and workflows.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
