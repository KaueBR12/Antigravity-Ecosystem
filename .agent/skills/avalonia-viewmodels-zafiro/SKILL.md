# Avalonia ViewModels with Zafiro

This skill provides a set of best practices and patterns for creating ViewModels, Wizards, and managing navigation in Avalonia applications, leveraging the power of **ReactiveUI** and the **Zafiro** toolkit.

## Core Principles

1.  **Functional-Reactive Approach**: Use ReactiveUI (`ReactiveObject`, `WhenAnyValue`, etc.) to handle state and logic.
2.  **Enhanced Commands**: Utilize `IEnhancedCommand` for better command management, including progress reporting and name/text attributes.
3.  **Wizard Pattern**: Implement complex flows using `SlimWizard` and `WizardBuilder` for a declarative and maintainable approach.
4.  **Automatic Section Discovery**: Use the `[Section]` attribute to register and discover UI sections automatically.
5.  **Clean Composition**: map ViewModels to Views using `DataTypeViewLocator` and manage dependencies in the `CompositionRoot`.

## Guides

- [ViewModels & Commands](viewmodels.md): Creating robust ViewModels and handling commands.
- [Wizards & Flows](wizards.md): Building multi-step wizards with `SlimWizard`.
- [Navigation & Sections](navigation_sections.md): Managing navigation and section-based UIs.
- [Composition & Mapping](composition.md): Best practices for View-ViewModel wiring and DI.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## Example Reference

For real-world implementations, refer to the **Angor** project:
- `CreateProjectFlowV2.cs`: Excellent example of complex Wizard building.
- `HomeViewModel.cs`: Simple section ViewModel using functional-reactive commands.
