# E2E Testing Patterns

Build reliable, fast, and maintainable end-to-end test suites that provide confidence to ship code quickly and catch regressions before users do.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing end-to-end test automation
- Debugging flaky or unreliable tests
- Testing critical user workflows
- Setting up CI/CD test pipelines
- Testing across multiple browsers
- Validating accessibility requirements
- Testing responsive designs
- Establishing E2E testing standards

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need unit or integration tests
- The environment cannot support stable UI automation
- You cannot provision safe test accounts or data

## Instructions

1. Identify critical user journeys and success criteria.
2. Build stable selectors and test data strategies.
3. Implement tests with retries, tracing, and isolation.
4. Run in CI with parallelization and artifact capture.

## Safety

- Avoid running destructive tests against production.
- Use dedicated test data and scrub sensitive output.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed E2E patterns and templates.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
