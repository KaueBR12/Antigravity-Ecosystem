# Lint and Validate Skill

> **MANDATORY:** Run appropriate validation tools after EVERY code change. Do not finish a task until the code is error-free.

### Procedures by Ecosystem

#### Node.js / TypeScript
1. **Lint/Fix:** `npm run lint` or `npx eslint "path" --fix`
2. **Types:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Security:** `npm audit --audit-level=high`

#### Python
1. **Linter (Ruff):** `ruff check "path" --fix` (Fast & Modern)
2. **Security (Bandit):** `bandit -r "path" -ll`
3. **Types (MyPy):** `mypy "path"`

## The Quality Loop
1. **Write/Edit Code**
2. **Run Audit:** `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Analyze Report:** Check the "FINAL AUDIT REPORT" section.
4. **Fix & Repeat:** Submitting code with "FINAL AUDIT" failures is NOT allowed.

## Error Handling
- If `lint` fails: Fix the style or syntax issues immediately.
- If `tsc` fails: Correct type mismatches before proceeding.
- If no tool is configured: Check the project root for `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml` and suggest creating one.

---
**Strict Rule:** No code should be committed or reported as "done" without passing these checks.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Command |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `scripts/lint_runner.py` | Unified lint check | `python scripts/lint_runner.py <project_path>` |
| `scripts/type_coverage.py` | Type coverage analysis | `python scripts/type_coverage.py <project_path>` |

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
