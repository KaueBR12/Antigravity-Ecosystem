# Makepad Reference

This category provides reference materials for debugging, code quality, and advanced layout patterns.

## Quick Navigation

| Topic | File | Use When |
|-------|------|----------|
| API Documentation | Official docs index, quick API reference | Finding detailed API info |
| Troubleshooting | Common errors and fixes | Build fails, runtime errors |
| Code Quality | Makepad-aware refactoring | Simplifying code safely |
| Adaptive Layout | Desktop/mobile responsive | Cross-platform layouts |

## Common Issues Quick Reference

| Error | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| `no matching field: font` | Use `text_style: <THEME_FONT_*>{}` |
| Color parse error (ends in `e`) | Change last digit (e.g., `#14141e` → `#14141f`) |
| `set_text` missing argument | Add `cx` as first argument |
| UI not updating | Call `redraw(cx)` after changes |
| Widget not found | Check ID spelling, use `ids!()` for paths |

## Debug Tips

```bash
# Run with line info for better error messages
MAKEPAD=lines cargo +nightly run
```

```rust
// Add logging
log!("Value: {:?}", my_value);
log!("State: {} / {}", self.counter, self.is_loading);
```

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
