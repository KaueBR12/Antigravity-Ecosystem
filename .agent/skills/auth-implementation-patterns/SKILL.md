# Authentication & Authorization Implementation Patterns

Build secure, scalable authentication and authorization systems using industry-standard patterns and modern best practices.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing user authentication systems
- Securing REST or GraphQL APIs
- Adding OAuth2/social login or SSO
- Designing session management or RBAC
- Debugging authentication or authorization issues

## Do not use this skill when

- You only need UI copy or login page styling
- The task is infrastructure-only without identity concerns
- You cannot change auth policies or credential storage

## Instructions

- Define users, tenants, flows, and threat model constraints.
- Choose auth strategy (session, JWT, OIDC) and token lifecycle.
- Design authorization model and policy enforcement points.
- Plan secrets storage, rotation, logging, and audit requirements.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Never log secrets, tokens, or credentials.
- Enforce least privilege and secure storage for keys.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
