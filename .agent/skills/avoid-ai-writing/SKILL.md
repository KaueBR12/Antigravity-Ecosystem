# Avoid AI Writing — Audit & Rewrite

Detects and fixes AI writing patterns ("AI-isms") that make text sound machine-generated. Covers 21 pattern categories with a 43-entry word/phrase replacement table that maps each flagged term to a specific, plainer alternative.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

- When asked to "remove AI-isms," "clean up AI writing," or "make this sound less like AI"
- After drafting content with AI and before publishing
- When editing any text that sounds like it was generated rather than written
- When auditing documentation, blog posts, marketing copy, or internal communications for AI tells

## What It Detects

**21 pattern categories:** formatting issues (em dashes, bold overuse, emoji headers, bullet-heavy sections), sentence structure problems (hedging, hollow intensifiers, rule of three), word/phrase replacements (43 entries like leverage→use, utilize→use, robust→reliable), template phrases, transition phrases, structural issues, significance inflation, copula avoidance, synonym cycling, vague attributions, filler phrases, generic conclusions, chatbot artifacts, notability name-dropping, superficial -ing analyses, promotional language, formulaic challenges, false ranges, inline-header lists, title case headings, and cutoff disclaimers.

## Example

**Prompt:**
```
Audit this for AI writing patterns:

"In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, developers are embarking on a pivotal journey to leverage cutting-edge tools that streamline their workflows. Moreover, these robust solutions serve as a testament to the industry's commitment to fostering seamless experiences."
```

**Output:** The skill returns four sections:
1. **Issues found** — every AI-ism quoted (landscape, embarking, pivotal, leverage, cutting-edge, streamline, robust, serves as, testament to, fostering, seamless, Moreover, In today's rapidly evolving...)
2. **Rewritten version** — "Developers are starting to use newer AI tools to simplify their work. These tools are reliable, and they're making development less painful."
3. **What changed** — summary of edits
4. **Second-pass audit** — re-reads the rewrite to catch any surviving tells

## Limitations

- Does not detect AI-generated code, only prose
- Pattern matching is guideline-based, not absolute — some flagged words are fine in context
- The replacement table suggests alternatives but the best choice depends on context
- Cannot verify factual claims or find real citations to replace vague attributions
