# Python Packaging

Comprehensive guide to creating, structuring, and distributing Python packages using modern packaging tools, pyproject.toml, and publishing to PyPI.

## Use this skill when

- Creating Python libraries for distribution
- Building command-line tools with entry points
- Publishing packages to PyPI or private repositories
- Setting up Python project structure
- Creating installable packages with dependencies
- Building wheels and source distributions
- Versioning and releasing Python packages
- Creating namespace packages
- Implementing package metadata and classifiers

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to python packaging
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
