# DDD Tactical Patterns

## Use this skill when

- Translating domain rules into code structures.
- Designing aggregate boundaries and invariants.
- Refactoring an anemic model into behavior-rich domain objects.
- Defining repository contracts and domain event boundaries.

## Do not use this skill when

- You are still defining strategic boundaries.
- The task is only API documentation or UI layout.
- Full DDD complexity is not justified.

## Instructions

1. Identify invariants first and design aggregates around them.
2. Model immutable value objects for validated concepts.
3. Keep domain behavior in domain objects, not controllers.
4. Emit domain events for meaningful state transitions.
5. Keep repositories at aggregate root boundaries.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## Example

```typescript
class Order {
  private status: "draft" | "submitted" = "draft";

  submit(itemsCount: number): void {
    if (itemsCount === 0) throw new Error("Order cannot be submitted empty");
    if (this.status !== "draft") throw new Error("Order already submitted");
    this.status = "submitted";
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not define deployment architecture.
- It does not choose databases or transport protocols.
- It should be paired with testing patterns for invariant coverage.
