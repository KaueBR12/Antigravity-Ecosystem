# Git Push Workflow

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:

- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

**ALWAYS use the script** - do NOT use manual git commands:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh
```

With custom message:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh "feat: add feature"
```

Script handles: staging, conventional commit message, Claude footer, push with -u flag.
