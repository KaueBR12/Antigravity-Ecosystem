# Asana Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Asana operations through Composio's Asana toolkit via Rube MCP.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Asana connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `asana`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.

1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `asana`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Asana OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Manage Tasks

**When to use**: User wants to create, search, list, or organize tasks

**Tool sequence**:
1. `ASANA_GET_MULTIPLE_WORKSPACES` - Get workspace ID [Prerequisite]
2. `ASANA_SEARCH_TASKS_IN_WORKSPACE` - Search tasks [Optional]
3. `ASANA_GET_TASKS_FROM_A_PROJECT` - List project tasks [Optional]
4. `ASANA_CREATE_A_TASK` - Create a new task [Optional]
5. `ASANA_GET_A_TASK` - Get task details [Optional]
6. `ASANA_CREATE_SUBTASK` - Create a subtask [Optional]
7. `ASANA_GET_TASK_SUBTASKS` - List subtasks [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `workspace`: Workspace GID (required for search/creation)
- `projects`: Array of project GIDs to add task to
- `name`: Task name
- `notes`: Task description
- `assignee`: Assignee (user GID or email)
- `due_on`: Due date (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Pitfalls**:
- Workspace GID is required for most operations; get it first
- Task GIDs are returned as strings, not integers
- Search is workspace-scoped, not project-scoped

### 2. Manage Projects and Sections

**When to use**: User wants to create projects, manage sections, or organize tasks

**Tool sequence**:
1. `ASANA_GET_WORKSPACE_PROJECTS` - List workspace projects [Optional]
2. `ASANA_GET_A_PROJECT` - Get project details [Optional]
3. `ASANA_CREATE_A_PROJECT` - Create a new project [Optional]
4. `ASANA_GET_SECTIONS_IN_PROJECT` - List sections [Optional]
5. `ASANA_CREATE_SECTION_IN_PROJECT` - Create a new section [Optional]
6. `ASANA_ADD_TASK_TO_SECTION` - Move task to section [Optional]
7. `ASANA_GET_TASKS_FROM_A_SECTION` - List tasks in section [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `project_gid`: Project GID
- `name`: Project or section name
- `workspace`: Workspace GID for creation
- `task`: Task GID for section assignment
- `section`: Section GID

**Pitfalls**:
- Projects belong to workspaces; workspace GID is needed for creation
- Sections are ordered within a project
- DUPLICATE_PROJECT creates a copy with optional task inclusion

### 3. Manage Teams and Users

**When to use**: User wants to list teams, team members, or workspace users

**Tool sequence**:
1. `ASANA_GET_TEAMS_IN_WORKSPACE` - List workspace teams [Optional]
2. `ASANA_GET_USERS_FOR_TEAM` - List team members [Optional]
3. `ASANA_GET_USERS_FOR_WORKSPACE` - List all workspace users [Optional]
4. `ASANA_GET_CURRENT_USER` - Get authenticated user [Optional]
5. `ASANA_GET_MULTIPLE_USERS` - Get multiple user details [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `workspace_gid`: Workspace GID
- `team_gid`: Team GID

**Pitfalls**:
- Users are workspace-scoped
- Team membership requires the team GID

### 4. Parallel Operations

**When to use**: User needs to perform bulk operations efficiently

**Tool sequence**:
1. `ASANA_SUBMIT_PARALLEL_REQUESTS` - Execute multiple API calls in parallel [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `actions`: Array of action objects with method, path, and data

**Pitfalls**:
- Each action must be a valid Asana API call
- Failed individual requests do not roll back successful ones

## Common Patterns

### ID Resolution

**Workspace name -> GID**:
```
1. Call ASANA_GET_MULTIPLE_WORKSPACES
2. Find workspace by name
3. Extract gid field
```

**Project name -> GID**:
```
1. Call ASANA_GET_WORKSPACE_PROJECTS with workspace GID
2. Find project by name
3. Extract gid field
```

### Pagination

- Asana uses cursor-based pagination with `offset` parameter
- Check for `next_page` in response
- Pass `offset` from `next_page.offset` for next request

## Known Pitfalls

**GID Format**:
- All Asana IDs are strings (GIDs), not integers
- GIDs are globally unique identifiers

**Workspace Scoping**:
- Most operations require a workspace context
- Tasks, projects, and users are workspace-scoped

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
