# Wiki Changelog

Generate structured changelogs from git history.

## When to Activate

- User asks "what changed recently", "generate a changelog", "summarize commits"
- User wants to understand recent development activity

## Procedure

1. Examine git log (commits, dates, authors, messages)
2. Group by time period: daily (last 7 days), weekly (older)
3. Classify each commit: Features (🆕), Fixes (🐛), Refactoring (🔄), Docs (📝), Config (🔧), Dependencies (📦), Breaking (⚠️)
4. Generate concise user-facing descriptions using project terminology

## Constraints

- Focus on user-facing changes
- Merge related commits into coherent descriptions
- Use project terminology from README
- Highlight breaking changes prominently with migration notes

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
