# Gemini Deep Research Skill

Run autonomous research tasks that plan, search, read, and synthesize information into comprehensive reports.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Performing market analysis
- Conducting competitive landscaping
- Creating literature reviews
- Doing technical research
- Performing due diligence
- Need detailed, cited research reports

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- httpx: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

## Setup

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file in the skill directory.

## Usage

### Start a research task
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research the history of Kubernetes"
```

### With structured output format
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Compare Python web frameworks" \
  --format "1. Executive Summary\n2. Comparison Table\n3. Recommendations"
```

### Stream progress in real-time
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Analyze EV battery market" --stream
```

### Start without waiting
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Research topic" --no-wait
```

### Check status of running research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --status <interaction_id>
```

### Wait for completion
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --wait <interaction_id>
```

### Continue from previous research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --query "Elaborate on point 2" --continue <interaction_id>
```

### List recent research
```bash
python3 scripts/research.py --list
```

## Output Formats

- **Default**: Human-readable markdown report
- **JSON** (`--json`): Structured data for programmatic use
- **Raw** (`--raw`): Unprocessed API response

## Cost & Time

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time | 2-10 minutes per task |
| Cost | $2-5 per task (varies by complexity) |
| Token usage | ~250k-900k input, ~60k-80k output |

## Best Use Cases

- Market analysis and competitive landscaping
- Technical literature reviews
- Due diligence research
- Historical research and timelines
- Comparative analysis (frameworks, products, technologies)

## Workflow

1. User requests research → Run `--query "..."`
2. Inform user of estimated time (2-10 minutes)
3. Monitor with `--stream` or poll with `--status`
4. Return formatted results
5. Use `--continue` for follow-up questions

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success
- **1**: Error (API error, config issue, timeout)
- **130**: Cancelled by user (Ctrl+C)
