# Imagen - AI Image Generation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates images using Google Gemini's image generation model (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`). It enables seamless image creation during any Claude Code session - whether you're building frontend UIs, creating documentation, or need visual representations of concepts.

**Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activate this skill when:
- User requests image generation (e.g., "generate an image of...", "create a picture...")
- Frontend development requires placeholder or actual images
- Documentation needs illustrations or diagrams
- Visualizing concepts, architectures, or ideas
- Creating icons, logos, or UI assets
- Any task where an AI-generated image would be helpful

## How It Works

1. Takes a text prompt describing the desired image
2. Calls Google Gemini API with image generation configuration
3. Saves the generated image to a specified location (defaults to current directory)
4. Returns the file path for use in your project

## Usage

### Python (Cross-Platform - Recommended)

```bash
# Basic usage
python scripts/generate_image.py "A futuristic city skyline at sunset"

# With custom output path
python scripts/generate_image.py "A minimalist app icon for a music player" "./assets/icons/music-icon.png"

# With custom size
python scripts/generate_image.py --size 2K "High resolution landscape" "./wallpaper.png"
```

## Requirements

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Python 3.6+ (uses standard library only, no pip install needed)

## Output

Generated images are saved as PNG files. The script returns:
- Success: Path to the generated image
- Failure: Error message with details

## Examples

### Frontend Development
```
User: "I need a hero image for my landing page - something abstract and tech-focused"
-> Generates and saves image, provides path for use in HTML/CSS
```

### Documentation
```
User: "Create a diagram showing microservices architecture"
-> Generates visual representation, ready for README or docs
```

### UI Assets
```
User: "Generate a placeholder avatar image for the user profile component"
-> Creates image in appropriate size for component use
```
