# Neon Postgres

## Patterns

### Prisma with Neon Connection

Configure Prisma for Neon with connection pooling.

Use two connection strings:
- DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client
- DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate

The pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections.
Direct connection required for migrations (DDL operations).

### Drizzle with Neon Serverless Driver

Use Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless HTTP driver for
edge/serverless environments.

Two driver options:
- neon-http: Single queries over HTTP (fastest for one-off queries)
- neon-serverless: WebSocket for transactions and sessions

### Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

Neon provides built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer.

Key limits:
- Up to 10,000 concurrent connections to pooler
- Connections still consume underlying Postgres connections
- 7 connections reserved for Neon superuser

Use pooled endpoint for application, direct for migrations.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
