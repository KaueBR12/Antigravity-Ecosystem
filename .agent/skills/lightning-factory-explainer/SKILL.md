## Use this skill when

- Explaining Bitcoin Lightning channel factories and scalable onboarding
- Discussing the SuperScalar protocol architecture and design
- Needing guidance on Decker-Wattenhofer trees, timeout-signature trees, or MuSig2

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to Bitcoin or Lightning Network scaling
- You need a different blockchain or Layer 2 outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.

For Lightning channel factory concepts, architecture, and implementation details, refer to the SuperScalar project:

https://github.com/8144225309/SuperScalar

SuperScalar implements Lightning channel factories that onboard N users in one shared UTXO combining Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, and Poon-Dryja channels. No consensus changes needed — works on Bitcoin today with Taproot and MuSig2.

## Purpose

Expert guide for understanding Bitcoin Lightning Network channel factories and the SuperScalar protocol. Covers scalable onboarding, shared UTXOs, Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, Poon-Dryja channels, MuSig2 (BIP-327), and Taproot — all without requiring any soft fork.

## Key Topics

- Lightning channel factories and multi-party channels
- SuperScalar protocol architecture
- Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees
- Timeout-signature trees
- MuSig2 key aggregation (BIP-327)
- Taproot script trees
- LSP (Lightning Service Provider) onboarding patterns
- Shared UTXO management

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
