# Avalonia Zafiro Development

This skill defines the mandatory conventions and behavioral rules for developing cross-platform applications with Avalonia UI and the Zafiro toolkit. These rules prioritize maintainability, correctness, and a functional-reactive approach.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Functional-Reactive MVVM**: Pure MVVM logic using DynamicData and ReactiveUI.
2.  **Safety & Predictability**: Explicit error handling with `Result` types and avoidance of exceptions for flow control.
3.  **Cross-Platform Excellence**: Strictly Avalonia-independent ViewModels and composition-over-inheritance.
4.  **Zafiro First**: Leverage existing Zafiro abstractions and helpers to avoid redundancy.

## Guides

- [Core Technical Skills & Architecture](core-technical-skills.md): Fundamental skills and architectural principles.
- [Naming & Coding Standards](naming-standards.md): Rules for naming, fields, and error handling.
- [Avalonia, Zafiro & Reactive Rules](avalonia-reactive-rules.md): Specific guidelines for UI, Zafiro integration, and DynamicData pipelines.
- [Zafiro Shortcuts](zafiro-shortcuts.md): Concise mappings for common Rx/Zafiro operations.
- [Common Patterns](patterns.md): Advanced patterns like `RefreshableCollection` and Validation.

## Procedure Before Writing Code

1.  **Search First**: Search the codebase for similar implementations or existing Zafiro helpers.
2.  **Reusable Extensions**: If a helper is missing, propose a new reusable extension method instead of inlining complex logic.
3.  **Reactive Pipelines**: Ensure DynamicData operators are used instead of plain Rx where applicable.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
