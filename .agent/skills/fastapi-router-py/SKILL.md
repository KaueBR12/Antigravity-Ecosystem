# FastAPI Router

Create FastAPI routers following established patterns with proper authentication, response models, and HTTP status codes.

## Quick Start

Copy the template from assets/template.py and replace placeholders:
- `{{ResourceName}}` → PascalCase name (e.g., `Project`)
- `{{resource_name}}` → snake_case name (e.g., `project`)
- `{{resource_plural}}` → plural form (e.g., `projects`)

## Authentication Patterns

```python
# Optional auth - returns None if not authenticated
current_user: Optional[User] = Depends(get_current_user)

# Required auth - raises 401 if not authenticated
current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user_required)
```

## Response Models

```python
@router.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def get_item(item_id: str) -> Item:
    ...

@router.get("/items", response_model=list[Item])
async def list_items() -> list[Item]:
    ...
```

## HTTP Status Codes

```python
@router.post("/items", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
@router.delete("/items/{id}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```

## Integration Steps

1. Create router in `src/backend/app/routers/`
2. Mount in `src/backend/app/main.py`
3. Create corresponding Pydantic models
4. Create service layer if needed
5. Add frontend API functions

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
