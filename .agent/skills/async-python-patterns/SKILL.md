# Async Python Patterns

Comprehensive guidance for implementing asynchronous Python applications using asyncio, concurrent programming patterns, and async/await for building high-performance, non-blocking systems.

## Use this skill when

- Building async web APIs (FastAPI, aiohttp, Sanic)
- Implementing concurrent I/O operations (database, file, network)
- Creating web scrapers with concurrent requests
- Developing real-time applications (WebSocket servers, chat systems)
- Processing multiple independent tasks simultaneously
- Building microservices with async communication
- Optimizing I/O-bound workloads
- Implementing async background tasks and queues

## Do not use this skill when

- The workload is CPU-bound with minimal I/O.
- A simple synchronous script is sufficient.
- The runtime environment cannot support asyncio/event loop usage.

## Instructions

- Clarify workload characteristics (I/O vs CPU), targets, and runtime constraints.
- Pick concurrency patterns (tasks, gather, queues, pools) with cancellation rules.
- Add timeouts, backpressure, and structured error handling.
- Include testing and debugging guidance for async code paths.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

Refer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
