# Performance Profiling

> Measure, analyze, optimize - in that order.

## 🔧 Runtime Scripts

**Execute these for automated profiling:**

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/lighthouse_audit.py` | Lighthouse performance audit | `python scripts/lighthouse_audit.py https://example.com` |

---

## 1. Core Web Vitals

### Targets

| Metric | Good | Poor | Measures |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **LCP** | < 2.5s | > 4.0s | Loading |
| **INP** | < 200ms | > 500ms | Interactivity |
| **CLS** | < 0.1 | > 0.25 | Stability |

### When to Measure

| Stage | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Development | Local Lighthouse |
| CI/CD | Lighthouse CI |
| Production | RUM (Real User Monitoring) |

---

## 2. Profiling Workflow

### The 4-Step Process

```
1. BASELINE → Measure current state
2. IDENTIFY → Find the bottleneck
3. FIX → Make targeted change
4. VALIDATE → Confirm improvement
```

### Profiling Tool Selection

| Problem | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Page load | Lighthouse |
| Bundle size | Bundle analyzer |
| Runtime | DevTools Performance |
| Memory | DevTools Memory |
| Network | DevTools Network |

---

## 3. Bundle Analysis

### What to Look For

| Issue | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Large dependencies | Top of bundle |
| Duplicate code | Multiple chunks |
| Unused code | Low coverage |
| Missing splits | Single large chunk |

### Optimization Actions

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Big library | Import specific modules |
| Duplicate deps | Dedupe, update versions |
| Route in main | Code split |
| Unused exports | Tree shake |

---

## 4. Runtime Profiling

### Performance Tab Analysis

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Long tasks (>50ms) | UI blocking |
| Many small tasks | Possible batching opportunity |
| Layout/paint | Rendering bottleneck |
| Script | JavaScript execution |

### Memory Tab Analysis

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Growing heap | Possible leak |
| Large retained | Check references |
| Detached DOM | Not cleaned up |

---

## 5. Common Bottlenecks

### By Symptom

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Slow initial load | Large JS, render blocking |
| Slow interactions | Heavy event handlers |
| Jank during scroll | Layout thrashing |
| Growing memory | Leaks, retained refs |

---

## 6. Quick Win Priorities

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Enable compression | High |
| 2 | Lazy load images | High |
| 3 | Code split routes | High |
| 4 | Cache static assets | Medium |
| 5 | Optimize images | Medium |

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Guess at problems | Profile first |
| Micro-optimize | Fix biggest issue |
| Optimize early | Optimize when needed |
| Ignore real users | Use RUM data |

---

> **Remember:** The fastest code is code that doesn't run. Remove before optimizing.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
