## Overview

This skill helps you configure and optimize Odoo Sales and CRM. It covers opportunity pipeline setup, automated lead assignment, quotation templates, pricelist strategies, sales team management, and the sales-to-invoice workflow.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use This Skill

## Examples

### Example 1: Configure CRM Pipeline Stages

```text
Menu: CRM → Configuration → Stages → New

Typical B2B Pipeline:
  Stage 1: New Lead          (probability: 10%)
  Stage 2: Qualified         (probability: 25%)
  Stage 3: Proposal Sent     (probability: 50%)
  Stage 4: Negotiation       (probability: 75%)
  Stage 5: Won               (is_won: YES — marks opportunity as closed-won)
  Stage 6: Lost              (mark as lost via the "Mark as Lost" button)

Tips:
  - Enable "Rotting Days" in CRM Settings to flag stale deals in red
  - In Odoo 16+, Predictive Lead Scoring (AI) auto-updates probability
    based on historical data. Disable it in Settings if you prefer manual
    stage-based probability.
```

### Example 2: Create a Quotation Template

```text
Menu: Sales → Configuration → Quotation Templates → New
(Requires the "Sales Management" module — enabled in Sales Settings)

Template Name: SaaS Annual Subscription
Valid for: 30 days

Lines:
  1. Platform License   | Qty: 1 | Price: $1,200/yr | (required)
  2. Onboarding Package | Qty: 1 | Price: $500       | Optional
  3. Premium Support    | Qty: 1 | Price: $300/yr    | Optional
  4. Extra User License | Qty: 0 | Price: $120/user  | Optional

Signature & Payment:
  ☑ Online Signature required before order confirmation
  ☑ Online Payment (deposit) — 50% upfront

Notes section:
  "Prices valid until expiration date. Subject to Schedule A terms."
```

### Example 3: Customer Tier Pricelist (VIP Discount)

```text
Menu: Sales → Configuration → Settings
  ☑ Enable Pricelists

Menu: Sales → Configuration → Pricelists → New

Name: VIP Customer — 15% Off
Currency: USD
Discount Policy: Show public price & discount on quotation

Rules:
  Apply To: All Products
  Compute Price: Discount
  Discount: 15%
  Min. Quantity: 1

Assign to a customer:
  Customer record → Sales & Purchase tab → Pricelist → VIP Customer
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Use **Lost Reasons** (CRM → Configuration → Lost Reasons) to build a dataset of why deals are lost — invaluable for sales coaching.
- ✅ **Do:** Enable **Sales Teams** with revenue targets so pipeline forecasting is meaningful per team.
- ✅ **Do:** Set **Expected Revenue** and **Closing Date** on every opportunity — these feed the revenue forecast dashboard.
- ✅ **Do:** Use **Quotation Templates** to standardize offers and reduce quoting time across the team.
- ❌ **Don't:** Skip the CRM opportunity when selling — going directly from lead to invoice breaks pipeline analytics.
- ❌ **Don't:** Manually edit prices on quotation lines as a workaround — set up proper pricelists instead.
- ❌ **Don't:** Ignore the **Predictive Lead Scoring** feature in v16+ — configure it with historical data for accurate forecasting.

## Limitations

- **Commission rules** are not built into Odoo CRM out of the box — they require custom development or third-party modules.
- The **Quotation Template** optional product feature requires the **Sale Management** module; it is not available in the base `sale` module.
- **Territory-based lead assignment** (geographic routing) requires custom rules or the Enterprise Leads module.
- Odoo CRM does not have native **email sequence / cadence** automation — use the **Email Marketing** or **Marketing Automation** modules for drip campaigns.
