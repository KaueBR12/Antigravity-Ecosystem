# Unsplash Integration Skill

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) provides the world's largest open collection of high-quality photos, essential for elevating the visual tone of any project.

## Context

Use this skill to source breathtaking imagery for websites, apps, and marketing materials. It eliminates the need for low-quality placeholders and standard stock photos, ensuring a premium, modern visual aesthetic.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when:

- Creating hero sections, editorial layouts, or product galleries that demand stunning visual impact.
- Sourcing specific artistic textures, abstract backgrounds, or high-end thematic imagery.
- Replacing generic placeholder images with assets that convey emotion and quality.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Search Intentionally**: Define highly descriptive, artistic keywords (e.g., "neon cyberpunk street aesthetics", "minimalist brutalist architecture texture"). Avoid generic searches like "meeting room" or "happy people".
2. **Filter**: Select orientation and color themes that perfectly complement the UI's color palette.
3. **Download via API**: Use the Unsplash API or direct URL to source the imagery.
4. **Dynamic Resizing**: Utilize Unsplash's dynamic image parameters (e.g., `?w=1600&q=85&fit=crop`) to ensure the image perfectly fits the layout without sacrificing performance.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. NEVER use generic, cliché, or corporate-looking stock photography. Choose images that feel artistic, premium, and unconventional.
- **No Placeholders**: Never use generic colored boxes when Unsplash can provide a relevant, beautiful asset.
- **Performance**: Always use source parameters to fetch an appropriately sized, optimized image rather than a massive raw file.
