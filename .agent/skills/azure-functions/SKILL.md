# Azure Functions

## Patterns

### Isolated Worker Model (.NET)

Modern .NET execution model with process isolation

### Node.js v4 Programming Model

Modern code-centric approach for TypeScript/JavaScript

### Python v2 Programming Model

Decorator-based approach for Python functions

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Blocking Async Calls

### ❌ New HttpClient Per Request

### ❌ In-Process Model for New Projects

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Issue | high | ## Use async pattern with Durable Functions |
| Issue | high | ## Use IHttpClientFactory (Recommended) |
| Issue | high | ## Always use async/await |
| Issue | medium | ## Configure maximum timeout (Consumption) |
| Issue | high | ## Use isolated worker for new projects |
| Issue | medium | ## Configure Application Insights properly |
| Issue | medium | ## Check extension bundle (most common) |
| Issue | medium | ## Add warmup trigger to initialize your code |

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
