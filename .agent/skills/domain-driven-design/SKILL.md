# Domain-Driven Design

## Use this skill when

- You need to model a complex business domain with explicit boundaries.
- You want to decide whether full DDD is worth the added complexity.
- You need to connect strategic design decisions to implementation patterns.
- You are planning CQRS, event sourcing, sagas, or projections from domain needs.

## Do not use this skill when

- The problem is simple CRUD with low business complexity.
- You only need localized bug fixes.
- There is no access to domain knowledge and no proxy product expert.

## Instructions

1. Run a viability check before committing to full DDD.
2. Produce strategic artifacts first: subdomains, bounded contexts, language glossary.
3. Route to specialized skills based on current task.
4. Define success criteria and evidence for each stage.

### Viability check

Use full DDD only when at least two of these are true:

- Business rules are complex or fast-changing.
- Multiple teams are causing model collisions.
- Integration contracts are unstable.
- Auditability and explicit invariants are critical.

### Routing map

- Strategic model and boundaries: `@ddd-strategic-design`
- Cross-context integrations and translation: `@ddd-context-mapping`
- Tactical code modeling: `@ddd-tactical-patterns`
- Read/write separation: `@cqrs-implementation`
- Event history as source of truth: `@event-sourcing-architect` and `@event-store-design`
- Long-running workflows: `@saga-orchestration`
- Read models: `@projection-patterns`
- Decision log: `@architecture-decision-records`

If templates are needed, open `references/ddd-deliverables.md`.

## Output requirements

Always return:

- Scope and assumptions
- Current stage (strategic, tactical, or evented)
- Explicit artifacts produced
- Open risks and next step recommendation

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.

## Examples

```text
Use @domain-driven-design to assess if this billing platform should adopt full DDD.
Then route to the right next skill and list artifacts we must produce this week.
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not replace direct workshops with domain experts.
- It does not provide framework-specific code generation.
- It should not be used as a justification to over-engineer simple systems.
