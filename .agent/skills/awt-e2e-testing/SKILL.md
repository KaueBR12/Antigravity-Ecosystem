# AWT — AI-Powered E2E Testing (Beta)

> `npx skills add ksgisang/awt-skill --skill awt -g`

AWT gives AI coding tools the ability to see and interact with web applications through a real browser. Your AI designs YAML test scenarios; AWT executes them with Playwright.

## What works now
- YAML scenarios → Playwright with human-like interaction
- Visual matching: OpenCV template + OCR (no CSS selectors needed)
- Platform auto-detection: Flutter, React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Structured failure diagnosis with investigation checklists
- Learning DB: failure→fix patterns in SQLite
- 5 AI providers: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama
- Skill Mode: no extra AI API key needed

Built with the help of AI coding tools — and designed to help AI coding tools test better.

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
