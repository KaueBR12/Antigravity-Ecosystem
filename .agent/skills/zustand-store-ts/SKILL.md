# Zustand Store

Create Zustand stores following established patterns with proper TypeScript types and middleware.

## Quick Start

Copy the template from assets/template.ts and replace placeholders:
- `{{StoreName}}` → PascalCase store name (e.g., `Project`)
- `{{description}}` → Brief description for JSDoc

## Always Use subscribeWithSelector

```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { subscribeWithSelector } from 'zustand/middleware';

export const useMyStore = create<MyStore>()(
  subscribeWithSelector((set, get) => ({
    // state and actions
  }))
);
```

## Separate State and Actions

```typescript
export interface MyState {
  items: Item[];
  isLoading: boolean;
}

export interface MyActions {
  addItem: (item: Item) => void;
  loadItems: () => Promise<void>;
}

export type MyStore = MyState & MyActions;
```

## Use Individual Selectors

```typescript
// Good - only re-renders when `items` changes
const items = useMyStore((state) => state.items);

// Avoid - re-renders on any state change
const { items, isLoading } = useMyStore();
```

## Subscribe Outside React

```typescript
useMyStore.subscribe(
  (state) => state.selectedId,
  (selectedId) => console.log('Selected:', selectedId)
);
```

## Integration Steps

1. Create store in `src/frontend/src/store/`
2. Export from `src/frontend/src/store/index.ts`
3. Add tests in `src/frontend/src/store/*.test.ts`

## 🏆 Market Best Practices & Clean Code (2026)

> *This section is universally enforced across all tasks performed by this skill.*

1. **Security First (Zero Trust)**:
   - Validate all inputs strictly.
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials.
   - Apply principle of least privilege in APIs and Database queries.
   - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

2. **Clean Code & SOLID Principles**:
   - Write code for humans first, machines second.
   - Functions must have a Single Responsibility and no side-effects.
   - Use highly descriptive variable/function names over comments.
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity low (avoid deep nesting).

3. **Test-Driven & Reliability (AAA Pattern)**:
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage (Unit > Integration > E2E).
   - Handle errors gracefully as values (e.g., Result/Either patterns) rather than throwing naked exceptions.

4. **Performance & Observability**:
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals (Frontend) and latency (Backend).
   - Implement structured logging and distributed tracing.
   - Design for horizontal scalability and graceful degradation.

5. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**:
   - Verify all generated logic against the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
   - Prioritize determinism and type safety over "clever" dynamic hacks.
